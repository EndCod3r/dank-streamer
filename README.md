# Dank Memer Auto Streamer for Discord

A simple script that streams for you on the Dank Memer Discord bot

## Tutorial

Start your stream

Run: `python GetMousePosition.py`

Hover over each of the buttons Run AD, Read Chat, and Collect Donations for 5 seconds each

You should see three sets of numbers

Open GetMousePosition.py in your editor of choice and change the RunADPos, ReadChatPos, and CollectDonationsPos variables to the first number of the position of the buttons.

Run: `python index.py` and it should work if not make an issue and I'll try to resolve it as soon as I can.

Enjoy!
